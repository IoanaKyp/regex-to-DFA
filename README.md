# regex-to-DFA
Scala project for an application which gets a string representing a regex  and returns the DFA in the form of sets of states and transitions. 

## This project is a continuation of the prenex-to-DFA project
- The new element is the module which gets a string input representing a regex in the normal form and returns it in the prenex form using words.
